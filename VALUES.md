## Reflections on Core Values

### Discipline
Throughout this project, I maintained discipline by adhering strictly to the task requirements and timeline. I broke down the work into daily milestones and completed each component systematically, ensuring no shortcuts were taken despite time constraints. This disciplined approach prevented scope creep and kept the project focused on the core AI assistant functionality.

### Responsibility
I took full responsibility for the project's success by thoroughly testing each component, fixing import issues, and ensuring the code was functional. When issues arose (like hardcoded responses), I addressed them proactively rather than ignoring them. I also ensured all deliverables were present and correctly implemented before submission.

### Honesty
I was honest in my implementation by not overpromising functionality. The mock tools clearly indicate they are simulations, and I didn't claim real AI capabilities. In documentation and code comments, I accurately represented what the system does and its limitations, providing transparent information for users and future developers.
